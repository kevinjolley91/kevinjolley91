I'm learning to become a web/software developer with an addiction to video games, especially 2D platforms in the Metroidvania genre.

I'm gaining experience with the Unity game engine and writing scripts to add features to the game. I'm also involved in a course that is teach me Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and *React*.
